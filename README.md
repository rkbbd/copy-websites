it easy to save a Web page as an HTML file or take screenshot for viewing offline, but that is far from your only option when you want to preserve some or all of the content on a Web page

+ Change website content (text, style) from live websites.

Support & Testing:
+ E-mail me for support: rakib424@gmail.com
